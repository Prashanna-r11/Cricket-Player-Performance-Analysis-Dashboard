# Cricket-Player-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard

Project Overview :

This project focuses on building a T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analytics Dashboard using Python, Web Scraping, Pandas, and Power BI. The goal is to analyze cricket player performance data and identify the Best 11 players for a T20 team.

Player data was scraped from JSON Files, then cleaned and transformed using Pandas. The final dashboard, built in Power BI, evaluates players across various roles such as openers, middle-order anchors, finishers, all-rounders, and bowlers, using key performance metrics like batting average, strike rate, and bowling economy.

With custom DAX measures and interactive tooltips, the dashboard provides actionable insights, enabling team strategists and analysts to make data-driven decisions. The selected team lineup has a 90% probability of winning based on historical data and player performance metrics.
